The tool segmentation-fold is a program that does RNA 2D-structure
prediction using a modified version of the Zuker algorithm. This
modification includes a new "structure element" that is capable of
folding a certain type of motifs (predefined sequences).
	The program includes some motifs; the K-turns. The thermodynamic
parameters (free Gibbs energy levels) have been estimated using a
biassed computational approach and lack accuracy.
