# INTRODUCTION #

[segmentation-fold](https://github.com/yhoogstrate/segmentation-fold) is
a bioinformatics application that predicts RNA 2D-structure with an
extended version of the Zuker algorithm. This modification contains a
new "structure element" named a *segment* and is capable of folding a
pre-defined substructure with **multiple** canonical or non-canonical
pairings.

This allows folding of more complex structures like the K-turns, which
are also part of the implemented free energy tables. These thermodynamic
parameters (free Gibbs energy levels) have been estimated using a
computational approach and therefore lack accuracy.
