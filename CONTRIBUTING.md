We encourage users, researchers and programmers to contribute to this
free and open source project. This can be achieved by reporting bugs and
commiting code to the github repository
https://github.com/yhoogstrate/segmentation-fold. To streamline and
archive communication in an univocal way, we encourge contributors to
only use this channel, Github, to contribute to segmentation-fold.
To contribute to segmentation-fold, please make use the following
documentation standard:
[http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html).
All source-code is formatted using Asteric Style: [http://astyle.sourceforge.net/](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/).
The corresponding configuration file is available at '[share/.astylerc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhoogstrate/segmentation-fold/master/share/.astylerc)'.
If you want to contribute to the code you should have it installed to 'beautify' the code, by simply running:

	make tidy

Cmake will make use of the correct syntax file and beautify all C++ and hpp files in
[src/](https://github.com/yhoogstrate/segmentation-fold/tree/master/src),
[include/](https://github.com/yhoogstrate/segmentation-fold/tree/master/include),
and
