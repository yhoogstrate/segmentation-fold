# CONTRIBUTING #

We encourage users, researchers and programmers to contribute to this free and open source project. This can be achieved by reporting bugs and commiting code to the github repository https://github.com/yhoogstrate/segmentation-fold. To streamline and archive communication in an univocal way, we encourge contributors to only use this channel, github, to contribute to segmentation-fold.

If any developer wants to contribute to segmentation-fold, please make use the following documentation standard: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html

All source-code is formatted using Asteric Style: http://astyle.sourceforge.net/ The corresponding configuration file is available under 'share/.astylerc'. If you want to contribute to the code you should have it installed to 'beautify' the code, by simply running:

	make tidy

Cmake will make use of the correct syntax file and beautify all C++ and hpp files in src/, include/ and test/.
